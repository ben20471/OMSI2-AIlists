# OMSI2-AIlists
Some AIlist files for the simulation game "OMSI 2"

## How to find the AIlist you are searching for
On this repositiory, you will find some folder, named after the map the AIlists are made for, and then a subfolder that either says "freeware" or "payware".
- Freeware: all busses are free
- Payware: some busses are paid

Then, a last subforder named after what the AIlist is adding and will contain
- `dependencies.txt`: links to all dependencies
- `readme.md`: why is this AIlist for?
- `ailist.cfg`: the AIlist. You need to put it in the root folder of your map. **You need to backup the original AIlist before erasing it!**
